## Project Description

Car Market Analysis is a database management system that allows users to analyze and explore a dataset related to the car market. The database contains information about various cars, including their specifications, pricing, sellers, owners, and dealers. The project aims to provide insights into the car market, such as popular car models, average selling prices, and transactions by different seller and dealer types.

## Database Schema

The project's database consists of the following tables:

1. `car_datasets`: This table stores detailed information about different cars, including their specifications, pricing, and ownership details. The primary key is `car_id`.

2. `Seller_type`: This table stores information about different types of sellers in the car market. The primary key is `seller_Id`.

3. `Owner_type`: This table stores information about different types of owners in the car market. The primary key is `owner_Id`.

4. `Dealer_type`: This table stores information about different types of dealers in the car market. The primary key is `dealer_Id`.

## Queries and Analysis

The database supports the following SQL queries to extract insights from the car dataset:

1. Find the latest year for each car model in the dataset.

2. Find the earliest year for each car model in the dataset.

3. Calculate the average selling price for each car model in the dataset.

4. Count the number of occurrences of each car model in the dataset and order them in descending order of occurrence.

5. Find the car model with the lowest mileage and the lowest selling price.

6. Count the number of transactions and the total selling price for each dealer type, excluding dealer type with `dealer_Id = 4`.

7. Count the number of transactions and the total selling price for a specific seller type with `seller_Id = 1`.
